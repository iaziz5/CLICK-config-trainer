# MQTT + Node-RED Interactive Trainer

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **MQTT + Node-RED Interactive Trainer** is a beginner-friendly, web-based tool that teaches users how to work with **MQTT** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and **Node-RED** in a safe, simulated environment.  

Instead of installing software locally and risking misconfiguration, users can **practice commands**, see **realistic terminal output**, and get **step-by-step explanations** â€” all inside their browser.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project is designed to make learning **IoT communication** and **flow-based programming**:
- **Less intimidating** â€” No setup required.
- **More hands-on** â€” Practice in a realistic simulated terminal.
- **Easier to remember** â€” Lamin-terms explanations connect plain language to technical concepts.
